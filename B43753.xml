            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:211321:5"/> are observ'd not to have had so happy a composition of the brain as other men; so that like Pyramids of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they are rather for ostentation than use, and are remembred in History not for any accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of mind, but chiefly, if not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the stature of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>There have been some Giants twenty eight foot long, they usually (as a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oracle observes) have no Cloathing but Beasts Skins that hang on them, and they usually eat no Bread, but raw Flesh; they drink abundance of Milk, they have no Houses, and they gladlier eat Mens flesh than other; there have been Giants (which is a greater wonder yet) of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five, or fifty foot long, some fifty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits long, as the same Author reports.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Artachaees,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menidae,</hi> a person in great favour with <hi>Xerxes,</hi> was the tallest man of all the rest of the <hi>Persians,</hi> for he lacked but the breadth of four fingers of full five Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits by the Royal Standard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a young Giant, whom <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> saw at <hi>Millain,</hi> who was so tall, that he could not stand but lie along, extending his Body the length of two Beds joyned together.</p>

He was proportionable in all parts, and had strength equal to his height; valour to his strength, temper to his valour, so that he disdained to do any injury to any single person; he would make nothing to take two of the tallest Yeomen of the Guard (like the Gizzard and Liver) under his Arms at once, and order them as he pleased.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:211321:9"/> the Body of a man; I wrote upon each of them what they were, and I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concluded them to be the bones of some Giant, because I found amongst them the lowest bone of the thumb, a cheek-tooth, the heel bone, the shoulder-blades, the Cannel-bone, which are only found in man of that form; also the long and thick bones of the Thighs, Legs, Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Arms, (the utmost ends of which with their Heads were found) and they differed in nothing from the bones of a humane Body: Having afterwards all the bones sent me to <hi>Basil</hi> (by the command of the Magistrates) and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligently upon them, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them with a Skeleton of mine own, (as well the whole as the broken) I was confirm'd in my opinion, and caused an entire Skeleton to be drawn of such great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as all those bones would have made, if they had been whole and together; it amounted to full nineteen foot in height; and since no Beast is found of that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is the more probable they were the bones of a Giant.</p>

               <head>Strange Passages of some Cheats and Pick-pockets.</head>
               <p>THE Emperor <hi>Aurelius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> saith <hi>Lampidius,</hi> was so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a hater of all Thieves, that if he chanced but to see any of them, he had his finger ready to pull out one of their eyes, and not only so, but it seems so great was his Antipathy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all that laboured under that kind of Infamy, that at the casual sight of any such, with the very commotion of his mind he would vomit up Choler, and such a sudden burning would come into his face, that he could not speak for the present so much as one single word. Great, sure, is that filthiness which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited a loathing in so gallant and great a man. But the Histories of these bold and subtile Practitioners will not (I hope) seem altogether so nauseous.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Maccus,</hi> a famous Cheat, came into the Shop of a Shoemaker at <hi>Leiden,</hi> and saluted him, casting his Eye upon a pair of Boots that hung up: the Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker asked him if he would buy them?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:211321:20"/> the other seemed willing, they were taken down, drawn on, and fitted him very well. Now, saith he, how well would a pair of double-soal'd Shoes fit these Boots, they were found and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his feet upon the Boots. Now, saith <hi>Maccus,</hi> Tell me true, Doth it never so fall out, that such as you have so fitted for a Race, as you have now done me, run away without paying? Never, said the other, but said, if it should be so, what would you then do? I would follow him, said the Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: well, said <hi>Maccus,</hi> I will trie, and thereupon began to run, the Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker immediately followed, crying, <hi>Stop Thief, stop Thief;</hi> at which the Citizens came out of their houses, but <hi>Maccus</hi> laughing, Let no man, said he hinder our Race, for we run for a Cup of Ale; whereupon all set themselves quiet Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of the Course, till <hi>Maccus</hi> had run quite away, and the poor Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker return'd swearing, and out of breath, and declared how he had been dealt with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the 5th. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a remove, while every man mas busied in putting up his stuff, there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:211321:21"/> entred a good fellow into the Hall, where the Emperour was, being mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied, and ready to take horse. This Thief, for so he was, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made great Reverence, presently went about taking down of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, making great haste, as if he had much business to do, and though it was not his profession, yet he went about it so nimbly, that he whose charge it was to take them down coming to do it, found that some body had easied him of that labour, and which was worse, of carrying them away too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Great was the boldness of an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Thief, who in the time of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, pla'd this Prank. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cardinal having made a great Feast in his house, and the silver Vessels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing locked up in a Trunk that stood in the Parlor next the Hall, where the Feast had been, while many were sitting and waiting in this Room for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, there came a man in with a Torch carried before him, bearing the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Steward, and having a Jacket on, who prayed those that sate on the Trunk, to rise up from it, because he was to use the same: which they having
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:211321:21"/> done, he made it to be taken up by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Porters that followed him in, and went clean away with it. And this was done while the Steward, and all the Servants of the house were at Supper.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. had a little Watch of admirable and rare Workmanship, in a great Croud he was robbed of it by a Courtier that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him; but the Watch it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the Thief, for it struck the hour of the day in his Pocket; at the sound of which the poor man surprized and affrighted, cast himself on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor, imploring his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which the Emperor easily granted.</p>
               <p n="5">5. At <hi>Antwerp</hi> not long since, there was a Priest, who had received a pretty round Sum in Silver, which he had put into a great Purse that hung upon his girdle: a certain Cheat had observed it, who came, and saluting of him civilly, tells him, that he was appointed by the Parish where he lived, to buy a new Surplice; he humbly begs therefore, that he would please to go with him to the place where they were sold, that he might be the better fitted, in as much as he was of the very same pitch and habit
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:211321:22"/> of body with the Priest of their Parish. He prevailed, and together they went. A Surplice was brought forth, and put upon him; the Seller said, it fitted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly. The Cheat, when he had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the Priest, now before, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, said it was too short before; that's not the fault of the Surplice, said the Shop-keeper, but is occasioned by the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stension of the Purse. The Priest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid down his Purse, that they might view it again; but no sooner had he turned his back, but the Cheat catched up the Purse, and away he run with it, the Priest followed in the Surplice, as he was: the Shop-keeper pursued the Priest, the Cheat said, stop the Priest, for he is mad; the people easily believed no less, when they saw him running in publick, and so habited, so that while one was a hinderance to the other, the Cheat got off clear with the Purse and Money of the poor Priest.</p>

                  <p>Yet however we may guess in the general that there are some Inhabitants in that Planet, for why else did Providence furnish that place with all such conveniencies of Habitation, as hath been declared? Cardinal <hi>de Cusa</hi> is of Opinion, that this place is Inhabited by Men, and Beasts, and Plants. To him assented <hi>Campenella,</hi> but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine whether they are Men, or rather some other kind of Creatures; if they were Men, then he thinks that they could not be infected with <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin; yet perhaps, says he, they might have some of their own, which might make them Subject to Misery. <hi>Others</hi> there are, that are of Opinion, that there are abundance of Inhabitants in this New World, but that they are of a quite different Nature from us here below.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:211321:32"/> Others again say, there are much People in this New World, and that they are of strange Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and Conceits, some desiring to live in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Men before Adam.</head>
               <p>THE false suggester who asserts, that there <hi>were men before Adam,</hi> doth insinuate his Poison to deceive unthinking people in the following manner (and il'e recite his own words <hi>verbatim</hi> that their Erroneousness may the better appear) <hi>viz.</hi> Nor do I much wonder (saies he) that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, handling these Verses of the Apostle have not been successful in the explaining of them, for they were every way streightned in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of these words, <hi>until the Law,</hi> for that Law was either to be understood of the Law given to <hi>Moses,</hi> or of the Law given to <hi>Adam:</hi> If that Law were understood of the Law given to <hi>Moses,</hi> it must needs be affirmed, that sin was in the World before <hi>Moses,</hi> and until <hi>Moses;</hi> but that sin was not imputed before <hi>Moses,</hi> if that Law were understood of the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> it must be held, that sin was in the World before <hi>Adam,</hi> and until <hi>Adam;</hi> but that sin was not imputed before therefore other men were to be allowed before, <hi>Adam,</hi> who indeed had sinn'd, but without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; because before the Law sins were not imputed. The <hi>Interpreters</hi> being between two such inconveniences, were at a stand, nor did know which way to turn themselves, but because it seemed less prejudicial to affirm, that sins were not imputed before <hi>Moses,</hi> and until <hi>Moses,</hi> than to affirm, that there were any other men either created or begotten before <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore they preferred the first inconvenience before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. The Interpreters rejected those fabulous men, which were to be believed to have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adam.</hi> But if my <hi>Teachers</hi> will give me leave, Il'e try whether the Exposition of these words to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:211321:35"/> the Law be not rather to be understood of the Law given to <hi>Adam:</hi> I do not deny, but to the first view to affirm, that there were <hi>Men before Adam,</hi> seems to trouble some mens Consciences, not to ease them, for people who are given to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Antiquity will fear and startle at the very mention, nay, at the very Thought of such a strange thing. And I know very well how dearly he suffered, who proved, that there were <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But it is not now, as it was then, being born in a better Age, and with better For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; I pray God to prevent such hatred. And therefore what I have studied upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That there were men before Adam,</hi> I shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to you in the <hi>following Essay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First then, I say, that so much the rather I gave my self to the finding out <hi>Men before Adam,</hi> because I thought there could from hence arise no inconvenience which is by the Gospel; for I thought the same would be the Fate of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net among Divines, as is of that of the motion of the Earth to <hi>Astronomers,</hi> for whether we think the Heavens turn round, or the Earth turn over, yet the Day and Night perpetually take their turns, and all the seasons of the year return at their just times, Corn flourishes in the Spring, which ripens in the Summer: Wines are prest in the Autum, which are cleared in the Winter. Likewise whether we think that <hi>Adam</hi> was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated alone, and that he was first of all men, or believe that there were men before him, all your Religion keeps its own place, for the ground of our Redemption consists in this, That we believe all men to have been c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now that the Antitype betwixt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our &amp; <hi>Adam,</hi> may more perfectly relate, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be more convenient to affirm, that there were men before <hi>Adam</hi> for that same Reason that Christ was not the last of all men: I say it will be more convenient to affirm, that that imputation from the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was returned upon those men which were before <hi>Adam,</hi> according to that Reason by which the imputation of Christ (by which we are freed from the sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon those men which were before Christ. And we have reason to believe that <hi>Adam</hi>) was not the first man that was made, for Holy Writ <hi>(saies this Author)</hi> never affirms it, nor ever intends it, nay, whence the contrary is gathered ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of it, whence we may easily conjecture, <hi>that there were men before Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover from this Tenet, which asserts <hi>men to have been before Adam,</hi> the History of <hi>Genesis</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in my oppinion much clearer, and agrees better with it self, and further, this really agrees with all <hi>prophane Records,</hi> whether <hi>Ancient</hi> or <hi>New,</hi> to wit, those of the <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians, Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Chinesians.</hi> And lastly, <hi>that men were created before Adam,</hi> may be gathered both from the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern Nations,</hi> all whom as likewise those of the first, and most ancient Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation were created with the Earth it self in all its parts thereof, and not propagated from <hi>Adam.</hi> And now I think it doth clearly appear by what hath been said (saies this erroneous Author) <hi>That there were men before Adam.</hi>

It may be doubted why other stars do not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise express their Image in Watry clouds, and so the number of them as to our sight should be multiplyed? It may be answerd that their light or beams are too feeble and week, to express any such similitude or likeness in the Watry clouds, for altho they have Garlands or Circles about them, that are caused in no power that is under them, yet it is manifest that this apparition hath not need of so strong a light, as is required to print the Images of them in the clouds. Again, the Garlands are direct under, and therefore apter to receive such apparition.</p>

He consults with the Soothsayers upon this dream, who answer him, that of his Daughter should be born a Son that should seise on the Empire of <hi>Asia,</hi> and divest him of his; terrified with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, he forthwith bestowed his daughter upon <hi>Cambyses,</hi> a Foreigner, and then an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure person: when his daughter drew near the time of delivery, he sends for her to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that whatsoever should be born of her should perish by his own command.

               <p>THE Wilderness is a strange place, and in it, as Men say, are the Trees of the Sun, and the Moon, that spake to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and told him of his Death: and Men say, that those that keep those Trees, and Eat of the Fruits of them, Live Four or Five Hundred Years, through the vertue of the Fruit; and we would gladly have gone thither; but I think that an Hundred Thousand Men of Arms could not pass that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness

I have heard say, why this Emperour is called <hi>P— J—,</hi> and for these that know it not, I will declare, Sometime there was an Emperour, a Noble Prince, and a Doughty, and he had many Christian Knights with him, and the Emperour thought he would see the Service in Christian Churches, and then was Churches of Christendom in <hi>Turkey, Sury,</hi> and <hi>Tartary, Hierusalem, Palestine, Araby,</hi> and <hi>Alapy,</hi> and in all the Land of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour came with a Christian Knight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and it was on a <hi>Saturday</hi> after <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> when the Bishop gave Orders: and he beheld the Service, and asked of the Knight what Folk those should be that stood before the Bishop?

               <head>A pleasant Treatise of the Earthly Paradise.</head>
               <p>IN this Paradise <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> was set, but they were but a little while there, and it lies towards the <hi>East,</hi> at the begining of the Earth; but that is not our <hi>East</hi> that we call, where the Sun riseth, for when their Sun riseth there, then it is Mid-night in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by reason of the roundness of the Earth: for our Lord made the Earth all round in the midst of the Firmament. Of Paradise can I not speak properly, for I have not been there: but that I have heard, I shall tell you. Men say, that Paradise <hi>Terrestre</hi> is the highest Land of all the World, and it is so high that it touchest near to the Circle of the Moon, for it is so high, that <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood might not come thereto, which covered all the Earth about.</p>
               <p>This Paradise <hi>Terrestre</hi> is inclosed all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a Wall, and that Wall is all covered with Moss, as it seemeth, that Men may see no stone nor nothing else whereof it is; and in the highest place
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:211321:56"/> of Paradise in the midst of it is a Well, that casteth out the Four Floods that run through divers Lands. The first Flood is called <hi>Pison</hi> or <hi>Ganges,</hi> and that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth through <hi>India;</hi> in that River are many precious Stones, and much <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Aloes,</hi> and Gravel of Gold. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is called <hi>Nilus</hi> or <hi>Giron,</hi> and that runneth through <hi>Ethiopiah</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The Third is called <hi>Tygree,</hi> and that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth through <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Armony</hi> the great. And the Fourth is called <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that runneth through <hi>Armony</hi> the less, and <hi>Persia:</hi> and Men say, that the sweet and fresh Waters of the World take their Springing of them. The first River is called <hi>Pison,</hi> that is to say, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of many Rivers together, and falling into one; and some call it <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> of a King that was in <hi>India,</hi> that Men call <hi>Gangeras,</hi> for it runneth through this Land: and this River is in some places clean, in some places troubled; in some places hot, in some places cold. The Second River is called <hi>Nilus</hi> or <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> for it is ever troubled; for <hi>Giron,</hi> is to say, trouble. The Third River is called <hi>Tygree,</hi> that is to say, fast run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for it runneth faster then any of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:211321:56"/> the other, named so of a Beast that Men call <hi>Tygris,</hi> for he runneth fast. The Fourth River is called <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that is to say, well bearing, for there groweth many good things upon that River. And ye shall understand that no Man living may go upon that Paradise, for by Land he may not go for wild Beasts that are in the Wilderness, and for Hills and Rocks which no Man may pass: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by those Rivers may any Man pass, for they come with so great a course, and so great Waves, that no Ship may Sail against them. Many great Lords have assayed many times to go by these Rivers into Paradise, but they might not speed in their way; for some Died for weariness in Rowing, some were Blind, and some Deaf with noise of the Wolves, so no Man may pass there, but through the special Grace of God.</p>

The manner of Teaching them to Dance is thus; they bring some young Elephant upon a Floor of Earth, that hath been Heated underneath, and they Play upon a Cittern or Tabour, while the poor Beast lifts up his Stumps very often from the hot Flower, more by reason of the Heat, than any desire to Dance. And this they practise so often until the Beast hath got such a habit of it, that when ever he hears any Musick, he falls a Dancing. <hi>Busbequius</hi> saw a Dancing Elephant in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the same Elephant playing at Ball, tossing it to another man with his Trunk, and receiving it back again.</p>
